In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run server`

Launches the json-server which I'm using for a jobs database.\
I have set the json-server to run on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3000) 

You need to run both commands in order for the application to use the json database
