# Tradie-App
A Typescript-React app where tradies can log, track, and delete jobs

You can visit this website here: https://biggie9925.github.io/Tradie-App/

Or you can find the code in the master branch.

I used json-server as a database for storing some jobs. Unfortunately Github Pages does not load these jobs.
