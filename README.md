# Tradie-App
A Typescript-React app where tradies can log, track, and delete jobs

You can visit this website here: https://biggie9925.github.io/Tradie-App/
I used json-server as a database for storing some jobs. Unfortunately Github Pages does not load these jobs.

I have also uploaded the full code with instructions on how to run in the master branch.
